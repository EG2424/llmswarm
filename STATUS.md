# 🎯 LLM Swarm Simulation - Status Report

## ✅ **SETUP COMPLETE AND FUNCTIONAL**

### **Environment Status**
- ✅ Virtual Environment: `llmswarm-env` created and activated
- ✅ All Dependencies: Successfully installed (FastAPI, Uvicorn, WebSockets, etc.)
- ✅ Server Status: **RUNNING** on http://localhost:8000 (Process ID: 12908)
- ✅ API Endpoints: All functional and responding correctly

### **Current State**
- 🔄 **Simulation**: Stopped (ready to start)
- 📊 **Entities**: 4 demo entities spawned
  - 2 Drones at (150,100) and (650,100) 
  - 2 Tanks at (300,300) and (500,400)
- 🌐 **Frontend**: Static files correctly served from `/static/`
- 📡 **WebSocket**: Ready for real-time communication

## 🚀 **Ready to Use!**

### **Access the Simulation**
**Open your web browser and navigate to:**
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### **What You Should See**
The interface should now display properly with:
- ✅ Dark theme styling applied
- ✅ All control buttons and sliders
- ✅ Canvas area for rendering
- ✅ Entity count showing "4" entities
- ✅ Chat panel and event logging ready

### **Initial Issues Fixed**
1. ✅ **Static File Paths**: Fixed `/static/` prefix for CSS and JS files
2. ✅ **Canvas Compatibility**: Replaced `roundRect` with custom implementation
3. ✅ **Demo Entities**: Added 4 entities for immediate visual feedback
4. ✅ **Type Annotations**: Fixed forward reference for Tank class

## 🎮 **Quick Start Guide**

1. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button
2. **Add Entities**: Use "+ Drone" and "+ Tank" buttons  
3. **Select Entities**: Click on entities in canvas
4. **Manual Control**: Use WASD keys when entity is selected
5. **Load Scenarios**: Choose from dropdown and click "Load"

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

**API Test Results:**
